# Homework01
Homework assignment 1 

1. Clone this respository to your local computer: use command `git clone` and paste in the link found under the **clone or download** button (or grab the zip file from that link). 

2. Open the repository folder in IntelliJ IDEA and then complete the 2 Todo's. 

3. Check your solution back into your repository:

* git status
* git add src/C.java (and any other changed files)
* git commit -m 'finished the todos' 
* git push 

(or using github desktop / version control (VCS) built into intelliJ IDEA)

4. Check github.com to ensure your modifications show up in the repository online. I'll try to add a comment if everything looks good. 

5. Keep in mind the deadline for this homework is 23:59h Sept 19, 2017

You can view TODO's in intellij by pressing:

* `âŒ˜6` (osx) 
or 
* by navigating to within the top menu bar to `View` -> `Tool Windows` -> `Todo` 

Todo's show up in a panel at the bottom of your working window. 

Read and understand the code, then you'll complete the `changeAX(int)` method in `class C` 
(and don't forget to include your **name and student id** at the top of the C class). 

Hint: 
Whereas casting to a baseclass doesn't allow you to access overidden methods, the behaviour is different with fields (instance variables).

### Remember this homework is a freebie - so we'll chat about it in class, but you should make sure you are comfortable with the submission process and the coding!!
Typically homework is graded out of 1 point.
